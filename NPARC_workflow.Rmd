This workflow shows how to reproduce the analysis described by [Childs, Bach, Franken et al. (2018): Non-parametric analysis of thermal proteome profiles reveals novel drug-binding proteins.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/22/373845)

# Data import

First we load the data from the different TPP experiments. All data have been downloaded from the supplements of the respective publications [@Savitski2014, @Franken2015, @Reinhard2015] converted into tidy format, and concatenated into one table. This table will be available as supplementary material to the paper in the future.

```{r}
tppData <- readRDS("tppData.Rds")
```
